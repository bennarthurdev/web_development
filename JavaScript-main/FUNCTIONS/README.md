# Teorical Explanations
The idea of functions follows from the concept of subroutines or procedures. This means, blocks of code that can be reused within the context of your application, without having to repeat writing them. 

JavaScript functions can be declared in different ways, the default template is:
```
function indetifier(param) {
 //code block here
 return obj;
}
```

See : https://github.com/bennarthurdev/JavaScript/blob/main/FUNCOES/declaringFunctions.js for for more ways to declare functions


identifier - Function name, you will use this name to call this procedure elsewhere in your application
param - identifier list of object


- Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects

- Functions defined inside objects are called methods

- Functions can initialize newly created objects, in which case they are called constructors
